    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Here at Looney's Cars we strive to give the best in class vehicular experience, whether that be purchasing
    a new vehicle, or purchasing parts you need for your current vehicle!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We manufacture vehicles for true driver's, for people passionate about cars. We don't only stick to sports
    cars, nor do we sit on the other side of the spectrum and only make SUVs. Instead, we prefer to make everything
    from trucks to SUVs to coupes, but with a twist: we make them driver centered, and fun while practical.</p>
